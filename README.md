# scraping-housing-adds
Practising web scraping and data cleaning by scraping the data of house sales.
The folder contains:

>jupyter notebook files asunnot_scraping & asunnot_cleaning. I used them to scrape housing add data from asunnot.oikotie.fi, clen it and save to file "housing.csv","clean_kt.csv"

>jupyter notebook files sold_scraping and sold_cleaning: scraping and cleaning data from asuntojen.hintatiedot.fi (records of sold property within the last year), and saving to file "soldcsv", "clean_sold.csv"

>jupyter notebook housing_compare: I took the cleaned data from the previous files to examine and compare.
